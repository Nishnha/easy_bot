# easy_bot
This discord bot began as a joke, but eventually snowballed into the larger project that it is now.
It does basic stuff like sending emojis, reacting with emojis, and supports role-dependent commands, as well
as display information about a user's most recent DotA 2 match, and can give a brief weather forecast of a given city.

The .awk script was used to parse the massive city JSON database to retrieve a python dictionary of each city name and its
corresponding ID.
